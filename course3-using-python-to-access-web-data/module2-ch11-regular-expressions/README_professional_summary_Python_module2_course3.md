🎯 Module Objective

This chapter introduces the concept of regular expressions (regex) — a powerful mini-language for searching and extracting text data based on patterns. Although optional in many Python tasks, mastering regular expressions can greatly enhance efficiency when parsing strings from websites, emails, or structured/unstructured files.

Topics covered include:

Basic regex symbols and syntax

Pattern matching for specific substrings

Extracting numerical data

Practical applications in string filtering

🪞 Reflection

This was the first major step into pattern-based data extraction, making it a useful bridge between foundational Python and more complex text-mining techniques. Understanding how to combine regular expressions with loops and conditionals opened the door to writing more compact and efficient parsing scripts — especially for cleaning and processing web data.
