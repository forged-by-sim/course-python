## 🎯 Module Objective

This module introduced the fundamentals of **network programming** using Python. We explored the client-server model, learned how to use the `socket` library, and examined how HTTP requests and responses are structured behind the scenes.

By learning how a basic web browser functions at the protocol level, we gained deeper insight into how data moves across the internet.

## 📚 Lectures & Readings

- **Understanding the Request/Response Cycle**
- **Using Developer Tools to Inspect Web Traffic**
- **Reading Raw HTTP Headers with Python**
- **Using the `socket` Library**
- **Decoding Byte Streams**

Each video was paired with real-world examples and browser demonstrations to help visualize the concepts.

## 📝 Assignments Completed

- ✅ **Quiz – Understanding the Request/Response Cycle**  
  Demonstrated comprehension of the lifecycle of a basic HTTP GET request and the parts of a server’s response.

- ✅ **Quiz – Networks and Sockets**  
  Explored how Python’s `socket` library mimics browser behavior by manually sending GET requests and interpreting raw byte responses.

## 🧠 Reflection

This module pulled back the curtain on the web. It gave me the ability to not just scrape data — but understand *how and why* that data is available in the first place. By seeing how Python can communicate directly with a server, I now have a better grasp of the request/response logic that powers APIs, websites, and dynamic applications.
