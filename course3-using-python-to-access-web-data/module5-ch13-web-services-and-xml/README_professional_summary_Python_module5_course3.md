## 🎯 Module Objective

This module introduced the structure and utility of **XML (Extensible Markup Language)**, which is frequently used for representing structured data in web services. Learners explored the differences between XML and HTML, and how to use Python's built-in XML parsing library (`xml.etree.ElementTree`) to extract values from nested data trees.

## 📚 Lectures & Readings

- What is XML?  
- XML vs. HTML  
- XML Trees, Tags, and Attributes  
- Parsing XML with Python  
- Navigating ElementTree objects

All core videos and readings were completed, and XML formatting principles were reinforced through both practice and challenge assignments.

## 📝 Assignments Completed

- ✅ **Quiz – Extensible Markup Language**  
  Reviewed XML rules, structure, and real-world use cases in web APIs.

- ✅ **Quiz – Extracting Data from XML**  
  Used Python to read an XML file, locate specific `<count>` elements, extract the numerical values, and compute their total sum.

📂 Files included:
- `extensible-markup-language.txt` – Quiz submission  
- `Extracting Data from XML.txt` – Final graded assignment  
- `Extracting Data from XML_Instructions.png` – Screenshot of the prompt

## 💬 Reflection

This module gave me a solid understanding of how XML encodes hierarchical data. Being able to access and extract values from nested tags prepares me for working with real-world APIs — especially those used in government, healthcare, and simulation data platforms where XML is still widely used.

I now feel confident navigating and extracting structured data from XML feeds using Python’s built-in tools.
