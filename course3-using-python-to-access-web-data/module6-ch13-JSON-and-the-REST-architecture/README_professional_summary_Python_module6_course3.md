📘 Module 6: JSON and the REST Architecture

Course: Using Python to Access Web Data
University: University of Michigan

Repo Subfolder: module6-ch13-JSON-and-the-REST-architecture
Completed: ✅ All videos, readings, and graded assessments

🎯 Module Objective

This module introduced how to interact with RESTful Web Services using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) in Python. We explored how to parse JSON data, understand the structure of RESTful APIs, and retrieve, navigate, and manipulate remote data using URL requests and responses. The core emphasis was placed on leveraging external web APIs such as OpenStreetMap’s GeoLocation API using Python’s built-in urllib and json libraries.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

urllib for making web requests

json for encoding/decoding JSON data

OpenStreetMap API (via JSON)

PNG screenshots and .txt files for proof-of-work and analysis

📌 Assignments Completed

✅ REST, JSON, and APIs.txt
→ Demonstrated use of urllib and json.loads() to interact with an external API and extract specific fields from the JSON response.

✅ Extracting Data from JSON.txt
→ Parsed a complex JSON structure, traversed nested dictionaries and lists to compute sums, and printed out results based on matching keys.

✅ Calling a JSON API.txt
→ Successfully constructed a RESTful request URL, received JSON data from a live API, and processed the data using json methods.

✅ Using a Geo Location API
→ Implemented a geo-location script that prompts the user for an address, sends a web request to OpenStreetMap, and extracts latitude and longitude from the JSON response. Screenshots:

💡 Reflection

This module was a hands-on introduction to modern data interaction workflows using APIs. I particularly appreciated how this section bridged abstract concepts (like REST architecture) with live, working examples involving real-world data. It strengthened my confidence in making web requests, parsing JSON data, and navigating the unpredictability of web-sourced information — foundational skills for any data-driven or simulation-based development project.
