🎯 Objective

This introductory module ensured that all learners had a functioning Python installation and a suitable text editor configured on their system. It included platform-specific instructions (Windows and macOS), emphasized the use of a terminal over browser-based Python editors, and required submission of screenshots as proof of environment setup.

📌 Assignments Completed

✅ Peer Review Assignment: Installing and Running Python – Screenshot Submission

Submitted three required screenshots:

📸 Python terminal running a basic program

📸 Text editor open with a Python script

📄 Summary reflection in a .txt file

🏆 Graded: 100%

🗂️ Folder Contents

Python Terminal.png – Screenshot showing Python successfully running in terminal

Text Editor.png – Screenshot of Python code written in a text editor

Peer Review: Installing and Running Python Screenshots.txt – Summary notes submitted during peer review

🧠 Reflection

Although this was a review for me, I appreciated how this module set expectations early for using a terminal-based workflow. Submitting real screenshots ensured I could verify my setup and document it for future debugging. This module marked the official shift from browser exercises to local Python development — something I’ll carry into future modules.
