## 📚 Module Overview

This non-coding module set the stage for the entire Python for Everybody specialization. It introduced the foundational **philosophy behind programming**, emphasized the accessibility of Python, and encouraged a growth mindset for beginners.

Key perspectives were shared by:
- **Dr. Chuck** (course instructor), who framed programming as a creative and empowering skill
- **Guido van Rossum** (Python creator), who welcomed students into the Python community

The module also covered:
- What it means to write a program
- Overview of computing hardware and software layers
- How software interacts with memory, logic, and decision-making

No assignments or quizzes were submitted during this module — it was purely conceptual.

## 💬 Reflection

Even without code, this module played an important role in helping me shift from user to creator. Dr. Chuck’s tone made programming feel human and personal — not just mechanical. The emphasis on *learning by doing* helped me feel confident enough to move forward, even if I had no prior experience.
