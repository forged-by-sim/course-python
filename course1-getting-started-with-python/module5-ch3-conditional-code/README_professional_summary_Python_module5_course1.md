## 📚 Module Overview

This module introduced **conditional execution** using `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements. We also explored **error handling** using `try` and `except`, allowing programs to handle invalid input gracefully.

By the end of the module, we understood how Python can be used to make decisions based on user input and how to protect programs from crashing due to bad data.

## 📝 Assignment: Overtime Pay Calculator

We created a program that asks the user for hours worked and hourly rate. If the hours exceed 40, the program calculates overtime pay at 1.5x the base rate.

✅ Assignment completed and saved as `.txt`  
🖼️ Three screenshots capture correct behavior with various inputs.

## 💬 Reflection

This assignment challenged me to think logically about different program paths — what happens when the user enters overtime, enters invalid data, or leaves inputs blank. Learning `try/except` helped me see how to create more robust and user-friendly applications.

This module was the turning point where Python began to feel like a *real tool* for solving problems.
