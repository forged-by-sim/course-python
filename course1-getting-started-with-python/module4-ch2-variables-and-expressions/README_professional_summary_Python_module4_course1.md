## 📚 Module Overview

This module introduced the building blocks of programming: **variables**, **expressions**, and **user input**. We explored how to store values, perform arithmetic operations, and evaluate expressions using Python’s `input()` function and numeric types (`int`, `float`).

We also learned how Python reads values as strings by default — and the importance of converting data types for calculations.

## 📝 Assignment: Welcome Message

We wrote a Python program that prompts the user for their name and then prints a personalized welcome message.

```plaintext
Enter your name:
Welcome [name]

💬 Reflection

This module showed me how to begin building dynamic programs that react to user input. I especially appreciated the way Dr. Chuck broke down type conversion — a concept that initially confused me, but now makes sense through practice. It was the first time I felt like I could write something interactive.

With variables and expressions under my belt, the path toward decision-making logic became clearer.
