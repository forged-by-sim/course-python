## 📚 Module Overview

This module introduced the core concept of **functions** in Python — reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. We learned how to define functions using `def`, pass arguments, return values, and organize logic into modular chunks.

By leveraging functions, we began building cleaner, more maintainable code.

## 📝 Assignment: Build Custom Functions

We created custom functions that calculate pay using reusable logic. The script requested user input for hours and rate, then used one or more defined functions to perform the calculation and display results.

✅ Assignment completed and saved as `.txt`  
🖼️ Three screenshots document the successful function output with varied inputs.

**Files included:**
- `Assignment_Build Functions.txt` – Function-based pay calculator  
- `Assignment_Build Functions1.png` – Output Example 1  
- `Assignment_Build Functions2.png` – Output Example 2  
- `Assignment_Build Functions3.png` – Output Example 3

## 💬 Reflection

This module helped me transition from writing procedural code to thinking in reusable blocks. Creating multiple outputs from a single function solidified my understanding of parameters and logic reuse. It also gave me a real appreciation for how much cleaner code becomes when it’s broken into pieces that “do one thing well.”

I can now confidently write simple functions — a foundational skill I’ll carry into larger projects.
