# 📘 Course 1: Getting Started with Python  
**University**: University of Michigan  
**Instructor**: Dr. Charles Severance  
**Platform**: Coursera  
**Completed**: ✅ All 7 Modules  
**Repo**: `course1-getting-started-with-python`

## 🎯 Course Objective

This course served as an introduction to Python programming for absolute beginners. It covered the foundations of how programming works, how Python is installed, and how to write simple programs using variables, expressions, conditionals, functions, and loops.

Designed as the entry point to the broader *Python for Everybody* specialization, the course emphasized clarity, syntax fluency, and confidence in reading and writing Python code — all through hands-on assignments and chapter-based quizzes.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python 3** (local installation)
- **Text Editor** (e.g., Notepad, VS Code)
- `.txt` and `.png` for assignments and screenshots
- Terminal / command-line for running scripts

## 📝 Module Summaries

### 📍 Module 1 – Why We Program  
An introduction to why programming is important, what we can do with it, and how computing powers the modern world. No coding, just philosophical and practical foundations.

---

### 🛠️ Module 2 – Installing Python  
Walked through installing Python and configuring a basic working environment. Verified installation and prepared system to run `.py` scripts locally.

---

### 🧠 Module 3 – Chapter 1: Why We Program  
Hands-on practice began with the first Python script: `print("Hello World")`.  
✅ Completed quiz and basic output screenshot.

---

### ✍️ Module 4 – Chapter 2: Variables & Expressions  
Learned how to assign variables, evaluate expressions, and use `input()` to receive user values.  
✅ Submitted text-based assignment and screenshot.

---

### 🔄 Module 5 – Chapter 3: Conditional Code  
Introduced logic and conditional structures: `if`, `else`, `try/except`.  
✅ Completed assignment handling user inputs and type casting.

---

### 🧮 Module 6 – Chapter 4: Functions  
Explored user-defined functions, parameters, and return values.  
✅ Wrote basic functions and reused them in scripts.

---

### 🔁 Module 7 – Chapter 5: Loops & Iterations  
Studied `for` and `while` loops, `break`, `continue`, and iterations over strings and lists.  
✅ Created scripts with nested loops and iterative logic.

## 💡 Reflection

This course solidified the basic mechanics of Python and helped build my foundational understanding of programming logic. From the simplicity of `print("Hello World")` to writing reusable functions and conditionals, I became comfortable working with Python syntax and solving beginner-level problems.

It also marked my shift from no-code simulation operations to code-driven workflows — opening the door to future technical growth in data, simulation, and XR.
