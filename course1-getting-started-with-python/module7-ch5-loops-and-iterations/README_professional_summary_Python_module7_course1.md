## 📚 Module Overview

This module introduced the powerful concept of **iteration** in Python using `for` and `while` loops. We explored how to traverse through strings and numeric sequences, how to maintain state using accumulator patterns, and how to properly exit from loops using sentinel values like `"done"`.

This was a major milestone in writing programs that can analyze, evaluate, and summarize data inputs.

## 📝 Assignment: Find the Largest and Smallest Numbers

We wrote a program that repeatedly accepts numeric input from the user and evaluates the **largest** and **smallest** values entered. The program ignores non-numeric input using `try/except`, exits gracefully when `"done"` is entered, and prints the final max/min results.

## 💬 Reflection

This assignment felt like writing a *real tool*. It accepted dynamic input, handled invalid entries, and ran until I told it to stop. I saw clearly how loops, conditionals, and variables come together to form working logic.

By the end of this module, I wasn’t just learning Python — I was using it.
