## 📚 Module Overview

This module introduced the foundational question: *Why do we program?*  
Dr. Chuck framed programming as a creative, empowering tool that allows us to control computers and build useful automations. We explored what a program is, how it's structured, and how software is layered over hardware to power everyday life.

This module also marked our very first step into hands-on programming — writing and running a simple Python script.

## 💬 Reflection

Writing my first line of Python code was a small but powerful moment. Seeing “Hello World” appear on the screen made the abstract idea of programming real — I was no longer just consuming technology; I was creating it.

This assignment reminded me of the magic behind even the simplest automation and set the tone for deeper learning ahead.
