# 📘 Course 2: Python Data Structures  
**University**: University of Michigan  
**Instructor**: Dr. Charles Severance  
**Platform**: Coursera  
**Completed**: ✅ All 7 Modules  
**Repo**: `course2-python-structures`

---

## 🎯 Course Objective

This course built upon the basics of Python by introducing the language’s **core data structures**: strings, lists, dictionaries, tuples, and files. Each module provided practice in storing, organizing, retrieving, and manipulating data efficiently using Python’s built-in features.

By the end of this course, I could solve real-world problems using layered logic, nested data types, and file-driven input/output techniques.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python 3** (local)
- `.txt` scripts and input files
- PNG screenshots of assignment results
- Coursera Python Playground (for testing)
- Command-line execution

## 🧩 Key Topics by Module

- **Module 1**: String slicing, searching, manipulation (`find()`, `strip()`, `replace()`)
- **Module 2**: System setup for working with files and editors
- **Module 3**: File I/O (`open()`, `.read()`, `.split()`, line-by-line iteration)
- **Module 4**: Lists, accumulation patterns, nested loops
- **Module 5**: Dictionaries, keys/values, counting patterns, `.get()`
- **Module 6**: Tuples, sorting by value, dictionary → tuple conversions
- **Module 7**: Graduation assignment + wrap-up

## 🧠 Reflection

This course leveled up my coding skills by making my programs smarter, faster, and more flexible. I now understand how to design logic around real-world structures: mapping items, parsing messy files, and transforming data formats.

It helped me see the *true power* of Python — not just as a scripting tool, but as a language built for clean and efficient problem-solving.
