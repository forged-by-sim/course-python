## 📚 Module Overview

This module introduced **tuples**, an immutable data structure used to store fixed-size, ordered data. We explored how to:

- Combine dictionaries and tuples for complex data analysis
- Use `.items()` to convert dictionaries into key/value pairs
- Sort tuples by value using `sorted()` and `reverse=True`
- Perform advanced counting and ranking operations

The focus was on using tuples to create leaderboard-like outputs or frequency-based summaries.

## 📝 Assignment: Sort and Count Messages

Built a script that reads a file, counts how many messages come from each email address, converts the dictionary into tuples, and displays the top results sorted by frequency.

✅ Assignment completed and saved as `.txt`  
🖼️ Screenshot proof included as `.png`

**Files included:**

## 💬 Reflection

Tuples completed the core of Python’s data structure toolkit. I now see how to mix and match dictionaries and tuples to analyze, rank, and display insights — especially in simulations and datasets where you need “Top 5” or “Most Frequent” style logic. It gave me a preview of how structured data analysis works in the real world.
