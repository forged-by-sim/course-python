## 📚 Module Overview

This module introduced **string manipulation techniques** in Python. We explored slicing, searching, replacing, and parsing text using string methods such as:

- `find()`, `lower()`, `upper()`
- `replace()`, `strip()`
- String slicing using `[:]`
- Working with delimiters (`@`, `:`)

These operations formed the foundation for parsing real-world text inputs like emails, filenames, and unstructured content.

## 📝 Assignment: Parse Text Strings

We created a program that reads a line of text, locates an email address, extracts the domain, and displays the result using string slicing and `find()`.

## 💬 Reflection

This module taught me how much power is hidden inside basic strings. I now understand how to pull apart emails, clean messy inputs, and prep data for deeper analysis — all using just a few built-in Python tools.

These skills will help tremendously in future projects involving logs, reports, and web data parsing.
