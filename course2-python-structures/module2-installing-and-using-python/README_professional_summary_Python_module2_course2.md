## 📚 Module Overview

This module helped ensure that all learners could successfully **run and test Python code**, regardless of their operating system or coding experience. It covered multiple options for writing and executing Python programs, including local installation and the Coursera “Python Code Playground.”

It included:
- Setting up Python on Windows and Mac
- Choosing a suitable text editor
- Using the Coursera browser-based code editor
- Installing screenshots for assignment submission

No assignment files or quizzes were required — the focus was purely on configuration.

## 💬 Reflection

This module was simple but essential — it made sure I was technically ready to complete the more complex assignments in later chapters. It reinforced my confidence in running code independently and prepared me to troubleshoot locally as needed.
