## 📚 Module Overview

This module introduced **Python dictionaries** — powerful key-value structures used to count, group, and analyze data efficiently. We explored how to:

- Initialize and populate dictionaries dynamically
- Use `.get()` and key-checking to simplify code
- Track frequency counts of strings and numerical values
- Loop through dictionary items using `.items()`
- Identify maximum values and associated keys

## 💬 Reflection

This was one of the most useful modules in the specialization. Dictionaries unlocked a whole new way to process text data, identify patterns, and make decisions based on frequency. I can now see how they’ll be essential for simulation logs, data pipelines, and statistical summaries.
