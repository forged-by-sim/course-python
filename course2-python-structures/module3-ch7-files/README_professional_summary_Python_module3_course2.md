## 📚 Module Overview

This module focused on working with **external text files** using Python’s built-in `open()`, `read()`, and file iteration methods. It showed how to:

- Read and convert text from files
- Loop through each line
- Clean text using `.strip()`, `.upper()`, and `.lower()`
- Extract meaningful values from real-world data

We also practiced using sentinel-controlled loops and accumulation logic while parsing files.

## 📝 Assignments Completed

### 📄 Assignment 1: Read a File and Convert Its Text  
Read an external file, then displayed and transformed its contents using uppercase formatting.

- `Assignment_Read a File and Convert Its Text.txt` – Program logic  
- `Assignment_Read a File and Convert Its Text1.png`  
- `Assignment_Read a File and Convert Its Text2.png`

---

### 📄 Assignment 2: Read a File and Process Its Data  
Read lines from a file, identified lines that started with a specific prefix, parsed the content using string operations, and extracted specific substrings or numerical data.

- `Assignment_Read a File and Process Its Data.txt` – Data parsing logic  
- `Assignment_Read a File and Process Its Data1.png`  
- `Assignment_Read a File and Process Its Data2.png`

## 💬 Reflection

This was the first time I saw Python interact with the “outside world” — reading real files, pulling in data line by line, and using loops to extract meaning. These patterns are extremely useful in simulation, logs, and data analysis — and I’ll be using them across many future projects.
