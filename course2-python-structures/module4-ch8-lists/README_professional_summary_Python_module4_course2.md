## 📚 Module Overview

This module introduced **lists** in Python — dynamic, ordered collections that support indexing, iteration, appending, sorting, and slicing.

We practiced:
- Building lists with `.append()`
- Removing duplicates using conditional checks
- Sorting lists alphabetically or numerically
- Using `split()` to tokenize strings into list elements
- Iterating with `for` loops and combining logic with `if` statements

## 💬 Reflection

Lists made it possible to build flexible, dynamic data structures in my code — everything from contact lists to unique keyword indexes. I began to see how to structure data for later processing, and how loops and conditions work together to extract meaningful insights.
