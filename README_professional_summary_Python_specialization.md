🎯 Specialization Objective

The Python for Everybody specialization introduced me to the full lifecycle of programming with Python — from writing simple scripts to retrieving, processing, storing, and visualizing structured data from the web.

Across five courses, I progressed from foundational syntax to real-world capstone projects that handled:

Web scraping

API access

SQL database modeling

Regular expressions

Data cleaning and transformation

Visualization (matplotlib, Google Charts, D3.js)

Full-stack data workflows

By the end, I had a complete understanding of how data moves from source → processing → storage → visualization, and how to automate each step with Python.

Regular Expressions (re module)

BeautifulSoup / urllib (HTML parsing & scraping)

JSON / XML parsing

Google Charts + D3.js (visualizations)

matplotlib
