🧩 Module 3: Data Models and Relational SQL

Course: Using Databases with Python
University: University of Michigan
Platform: Coursera
Repo Directory: module3-ch15-data-models-and-relational-sql
Date Completed: ✅ 

⸻

🎯 Module Objective

This module introduced relational database modeling, focusing on how data is organized across multiple tables using relationships. I learned how to:

Design a relational schema from conceptual models

Insert, link, and retrieve data using foreign keys and JOIN operations

Use multi-table SQL queries to extract connected information from normalized data

Simulate real-world use cases like a musical track database

⸻

🧠 Key Concepts

Data Modeling: Representing data using related tables (tracks, albums, artists, genres)

JOIN Statements: Combining rows from multiple tables based on related keys

Relational Integrity: Using foreign keys and constraints to preserve consistency

CSV Import: Loading external data into a structured database format

Application Scripting: Writing Python scripts to interact with SQL databases

⸻

🧪 Assignments Completed

✅ Multi-Table Relational SQL

Wrote SQL queries to extract data from multiple tables using JOIN

Demonstrated relational thinking and foreign key chaining

✅ Multi-Table Database – Tracks.py

Parsed and loaded data from tracks.csv into trackdb.sqlite

Used Python + SQLite to build a multi-table relational database

Extracted a track list by genre, artist, and album

Graded App Item: 100%

📁 Bonus: I also reviewed prior iterations of the tracks.py script in a subfolder old tracks files, comparing logic and structure over time.

💬 Reflection

This module helped me connect the dots between theory and application. Writing SQL JOIN queries and then seeing the results in a real database made abstract relationships feel concrete. The musical database provided a fun context to practice linking tables together using primary and foreign keys. Working with .csv, .sqlite, and .py in sync mimicked real data ingestion workflows.

I now feel confident designing normalized schemas and querying across multiple tables using both SQL and Python.
