🎯 Module Objective

This module introduced the four core CRUD operations—Create, Read, Update, and Delete—as the foundational building blocks for managing structured data within relational databases. Using Python in tandem with SQLite, I learned how to build, query, and update a local database through real-world examples. The module emphasized working with single-table schemas using SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands via Python scripts and SQL statements.

🧠 Key Concepts

Difference between databases and flat files

Introduction to relational databases and SQLite

How Python connects to and manipulates databases

Crafting SQL queries inside .py scripts

Using cursor.execute() and commit() for transactions

Extracting and parsing data with SELECT and WHERE clauses

⸻

🧪 Assignments Completed

Single Table SQL
Practiced creating, reading, updating, and deleting rows from a single database table using SQL syntax.

Our First Database
Built and populated a SQLite database (emaildb.sqlite) from a raw text file using Python. This included counting domain frequencies from email addresses.

Counting Email in a Database
Extended database use by querying for frequency data, outputting counts by organization domain, and sorting results using ORDER BY.

💬 Reflection

This module solidified my comfort with using databases alongside Python. The process of dynamically creating a database, inserting values via loops, and querying results felt intuitive and empowering. It deepened my understanding of how data-driven applications are built and introduced me to real-world ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines. I now see SQL and Python as a power duo for simulation logging, analytics, and backend workflows.
