📘 Module 1: Object-Oriented Python

Course: Using Databases with Python
Specialization: Python for Everybody
Platform: Coursera – University of Michigan
Folder: module1-ch14-object-oriented-python
Completed: ✅

🎯 Objective

This introductory module establishes the groundwork for using object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python — a key paradigm for building scalable applications and data structures. It focused on how to define custom classes, use methods, manage object state, and extend built-in types, all of which set the stage for building more complex data-driven systems like databases.

🧠 Key Concepts Covered

Understanding classes, instances, and attributes

Defining and using methods

Leveraging Python’s __init__() constructor

Working with encoded data in Python 3

Connecting OOP structures to upcoming database concepts

📂 Folder Contents

object-oriented-programming.txt – Notes and exercises demonstrating custom class creation, method logic, and object interactions.

using-encoded-data-in-python-3.txt – Supplemental material showcasing how to decode and process character data in Python 3, often encountered when working with web data or APIs.

✍️ Reflection

This module was an excellent refresher on core OOP principles in Python, linking object design patterns with data management techniques. It laid the foundation for deeper exploration into structured data handling in the later modules. While simple in structure, this module helped build confidence with class syntax and object interaction that are critical for scalable and maintainable code.
