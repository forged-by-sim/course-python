📘 Course 4: Using Databases with Python

Specialization: Python for Everybody
Platform: Coursera – University of Michigan
Completed: ✅ All 5 Modules
Directory: course4-using-databases-with-python

🎯 Course Objective

This course focused on how to use Python to interact with databases using SQLite3. It introduced the foundational concepts of database modeling, structured query language (SQL), and visualizing data relationships through both simple and complex data structures. The course concluded with a deep dive into many-to-many relationships and creating database-driven visualizations.

Through hands-on practice, I learned how to write Python programs that read, update, and visualize data stored in relational databases.

💻 .py Python scripts (for SQL execution, parsing, joins, visualizations, etc.)

📚 Modules Overview
🔹 Module 1: Object-Oriented Python (module1-ch14-object-oriented-python)

Introduced object-oriented programming in Python, laying a foundation for how classes and objects could be used to structure database code. I practiced building custom objects and understanding inheritance structures that mirrored real-world data logic.

🔹 Module 2: Basic Structured Query Language (SQL) (module2-ch15-basic-structured-query-language)

Learned how to create tables, insert data, query it with SELECT, filter using WHERE, sort with ORDER BY, and use JOIN to connect data across tables.

🔹 Module 3: Data Models and Relational SQL (module3-ch15-data-models-and-relational)

Explored how to model data logically with foreign keys and relationships between entities. I wrote Python scripts that automated the creation of normalized tables and populated them through user-driven input or parsing scripts.

🔹 Module 4: Many-to-Many Relationships in SQL (module4-ch15-many-to-many-relationships)

Built relational tables that captured complex real-world interactions (e.g., students and courses, artists and albums). Focused on linking tables, composite keys, and parsing structured files into normalized databases.

🔹 Module 5: Databases and Data Visualization (module5-ch16-databases-and-visualization)

Used SQL queries to extract data and Python to visualize trends, timelines, and patterns in email or social media datasets. Finished with generating timeline plots using matplotlib from structured .sqlite files.

🧠 Reflection

This course gave me real confidence in applying database logic within Python. The combination of SQLite3 and Python allowed for realistic simulation of data-driven workflows—useful for everything from simulation data tracking to backend support in XR applications. My favorite segment was visualizing email metadata, which echoed many industry use-cases for lightweight database-backed dashboards.
