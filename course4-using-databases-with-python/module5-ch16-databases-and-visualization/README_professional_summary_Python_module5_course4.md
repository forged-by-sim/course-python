🗺️ Module 5: Databases and Visualization

Chapter 16 – Using Databases with Python
Platform: Coursera — University of Michigan
Directory: module5-ch16-databases-and-visualization

⸻

🎯 Objective

This module brought everything together from earlier lessons—object-oriented programming, SQL, and data modeling—and applied it to real-world geospatial visualization. We learned how to retrieve data from external sources, parse it into a database, and plot the results on a map using the OpenStreetMaps API with JavaScript.

📌 Key Concepts Covered

Geocoding and JSON parsing

Using SQLite to store location data

Generating a .js file for data points

Visualizing location data with OpenStreetMaps

Peer-reviewed project integration

🧠 What I Did

Learned to use geoload.py to pull and store location data from the OpenStreetMap geocoding API.

Used geodump.py to convert the SQLite data into a JavaScript array.

Visualized my data using where.html, which used the Google/OSM Maps API to plot the custom dataset.

Submitted a peer-graded assignment using a university in Florida as the custom data point, including:

Three screenshots (terminal logs, SQLite data, and plotted map)

A zip file of code and data

A written breakdown of the solution

🧠 Reflection

This was my favorite module of the course. It brought theory to life by allowing me to see my code’s output plotted on a real-world map. I appreciated the clarity of the instructions and the satisfaction of connecting multiple technologies—from Python to SQL to JavaScript—in a seamless data pipeline. It was a rewarding way to close the course.
